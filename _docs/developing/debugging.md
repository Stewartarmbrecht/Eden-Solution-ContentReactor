# Debugging

## Debugging Locally

This solution relies on VS code for debugging.  Given this system 
is built using native cloud services, you are not expected to run the 
function app locally for debugging purposes.  The only debugging expected
locally is for unit testing.  VS Code supports debugging unit tests, one 
at a time, through the code lense 'Debug Unit' test option.
