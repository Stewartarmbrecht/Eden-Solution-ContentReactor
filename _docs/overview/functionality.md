# Functionality

## Overview

The application itself is a personal knowledge management system, and it allows users to upload text, images, and audio for these to be placed into categories. Each of these types of data is managed by a dedicated microservice built on Azure serverless technologies including [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) and [Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/welcome). The web front-end communicates with the microservices through a SignalR-to-Event Grid bridge, allowing for real-time reactive UI updates based on the microservice updates. Each microservice is built and deployed independently using VSTSâ€™s build and release management system, and use a variety of Azure-native data storage technologies.
